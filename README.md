### Hi, ðŸ‘‹ I am Rodrigo Vieira - FullStack Web Developer

I am fascinated by the Web Development area and everything that involves the Internet and its technologies.
I started studying PHP in 2010 and have been following the path of Web Development ever since.
On top of my studies in Front-end and Back-end, I am also very interested in Cybersecurity, DevOps and Data Science.

I am currently developing a Full-Stack Framework in PHP, which I intend to release soon under MIT license.
I have also been a frequent contributor to the [Quasar Framework](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/issues?q=is%3Aissue+author%3Arodrigoslayertech+is%3Aclosed) source code since 2017, having submitted several Issues and Pull Requests.
